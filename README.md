# hello-world
my first repository

My plan for the next five years is to work on a long term remote contract which will have several projects where I can bring my vast expertise and experience to make a difference in the outcome and work with a great remote team of people.

Given access to your computing devices, manuals (online/offline), I can program them to do what is required. 


Here are some examples:

On one project, I drove brush recorders  with a sine wave function that I programmed on a 24 bit mini-computer in assembly language using the Taylor series from a college CRC reference manual.

On another project, I analyzed return data from a ground based laser radar tracking system to determine the rate of spin of target satellites in orbit using latest information in current articles provided by the scientist on the project that described Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and Power Spectrum Densities (PSD) which I programmed in FORTRAN and plotted the resulting  power frequency spectrum graph.

On a more recent project, I extracted policy information, coverages, lienholders, etc. that were effective at the date of loss (DOL) in C#.NET WCF Web Services based upon an XML document for a Claims Workstation.  

I developed and hosted an on-line .NET/C# SQL Server database web application to allow beverage distributor customers to see at a glance the age and accumulated balance of their accounts, developed it in Java Servlets ported it to .NET/C#.

I created a procedure to extract the information from their in house WOD accounting database.
Later, I was called back because they opted to have their database hosted on an AS400 remote server using a VIP database.  They created an account on the remote AS400 server for my access and I was able to change the extraction procedure to pull the same information from the VIP database.  No changes were needed to the Web application.
